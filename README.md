- ✏️ text editor of choice: `vim`

I'm in the Web Administration team, 12th floor, HQ, Alhambra. I fully embrace DevOps philosophies (CALMS - Collaboration, Automation, Learning, Measurement, and Sharing) and would like to do a case study on how SRE culture can be cultivated within public sector organizations.

I'm a student at Pasadena City College and intend to transfer Spring 2026 to Cal State LA, studying Cybersecurity.
