I'm in the Web Administration team, 12th floor, HQ, Alhambra. I fully embrace DevOps philosophies (CALMS - Collaboration, Automation, Learning, Measurement, and Sharing) and would like to do a case study on how SRE culture can be cultivated within public sector organizations.

I'm a student at Pasadena City College and intend to transfer in 2026 to Cal State LA, studying [Computer Information Systems](https://ecatalog.calstatela.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=75&poid=34309#core_276193).
